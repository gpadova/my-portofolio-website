<h5>Collaboration and Methodolgy</h5>
Drivent was a collaborative effort among a team of five developers, including myself. We used the Scrum methodology to guide our development process, which allowed us to work in sprints and prioritize tasks effectively. During each sprint, we held daily stand-up meetings to review progress and discuss any challenges. We also conducted regular retrospectives to reflect on our process and identify areas for improvement.

Through effective collaboration and the use of Scrum, we were able to deliver a high-quality product that met the needs of event organizers and attendees alike. Each team member brought their unique skills and perspectives to the project, and we worked together to overcome challenges and ensure that the application was functional and user-friendly.
