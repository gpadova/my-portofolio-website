          <p>
            Hey there, I'm Giovanni Padova, a 25-year-old living it up in the
            vibrant city of Florianopolis, Brazil! I've got a knack for
            tinkering with tech. I kicked things off by diving into Electrical
            Engineering. Nowadays, I'm working as a full stack developer for a
            Health Startup that's turning heads with its groundbreaking approach
            to treating autistic children.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In my role as a full-stack developer, I'm the mastermind behind
            crafting web applications from top to bottom. Whether it's polishing
            up the frontend or diving deep into the backend, I thrive on taking
            ownership of every aspect. I breathe life into sleek and modern user
            interfaces, harnessing the power of React to create experiences that
            are as responsive as they are eye-catching.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Behind the scenes, I'm weaving together the intricate threads of
            business logic and API integration, flexing my muscles with Java and
            Quarkus to ensure our applications run like well-oiled machines. And
            when it's time to unleash our creations into the digital wild, I
            turn to Google Cloud Platform, armed with Docker and Docker Compose
            to orchestrate seamless deployments that scale effortlessly.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            During my time at University, I had tons of hands on experience with
            programming languages, particularly C, Assembly, and MatLab. With
            extensive coursework and practical experience, I have developed a
            deep understanding of these languages and their applications in the
            field of electrical engineering. In C, I am proficient in
            implementing data structures and designing algorithms to create
            efficient and reliable software solutions. Assembly language has
            given me hands-on experience in working with low-level programming,
            understanding computer architecture, and manipulating registers,
            memory, and control flow. Additionally, I have honed my skills in
            MatLab, utilizing it for numerical computation, data analysis, and
            algorithm development. My expertise in these programming languages
            enables me to tackle complex Computer Science challenges and deliver
            innovative solutions with precision and efficiency.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In the bootcamp, I was taught all the fundamentals of web
            development. During the bootcamp, I gained experience with the Scrum
            methodology and learned how to be a software engineer.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The bootcamp provided me with a comprehensive understanding of web
            development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks
            such as React and Node.js. I also learned about database management,
            APIs, and other important topics in web development.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Moreover, the bootcamp gave me practical experience by working on
            real-world projects, allowing me to hone my skills and gain
            confidence in my abilities. Through the Scrum methodology, I learned
            how to work efficiently in a team and manage projects effectively.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Overall, the web development bootcamp was a valuable experience that
            helped me develop a strong foundation in web development and taught
            me important skills that I can apply in my career as a software
            engineer.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In my first internship, I worked as a customer support
            representative in the telecommunications industry. I focused on
            improving customer satisfaction by reducing response times,
            implementing more efficient processes, and improving technical
            skills and product knowledge.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In my second internship, I worked as a Customer Success Specialist,
            where I developed and implemented strategies to improve the customer
            journey and collaborated with the support team to improve response
            times and quality of responses. I also conducted customer research
            and identified areas for improvement in the company's internal
            processes to improve efficiency and effectiveness.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In addition to my internships, I have worked as a cook in a
            restaurant at a Ski Resort in Colorado. My responsibilities included
            preparing ingredients, planning meals, coordinating the organization
            and cleanliness of the work area, and operating in compliance with
            food safety standards and hygiene procedures.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I'm also a strong communicator and collaborator. I enjoy working
            with others to achieve project goals and am always willing to go the
            extra mile to ensure success. My ability to think creatively and
            outside the box enables me to come up with unique solutions to
            complex development challenges.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, chess, and cycling. Cooking allows
            me to experiment with new recipes and ingredients while chess
            provides a mental challenge that helps me develop my critical
            thinking skills. Cycling, on the other hand, keeps me active and
            allows me to explore the beautiful scenery around Florianopolis.
